CNatural (or SCNatural or Natural) is a program for remote
control of embed systems.

This program is an implementation of NodeNatural
(http://github.com/alinarezrangel/node-natural) but is implemented
in C instead of NodeJS. It's intended to be 100% compatible with the
Natural Minimal APIs (like NGraph, NInt, NWidgets and others).
