# From scratch: The Native Desktop #

In CNatural there are multiples desktop managers, these control the appareance
and usability of the desktop. This guide only covers the default desktop
manager: **Native**. Native is a desktop manager focused on be resonsible and
simple. It uniwindow window manager can display only one window at time, being
based on the Android (tm) OS default window manager. Unlike Android (tm),
the shell itself is based on the old **Pure** desktop for NodeNatural, which
is based on the more old **NDesk** desktop for NodeNatural too.

The shell have *docks*. These docks contains fragments of GUI (Graphical User
Interface) which will not hidden if you open a window. The main components are
the topbar, which you can see at the top of the screen and the sidebar, which
is displayed only when the screen size is not small. The sidebar is located
at the left of the screen and can be customized.

When a window is opened or minimized, all docks change their color from
*semitransparent* to *black*.

## Topbar ##

The main component of Native is the topbar, which only have two (2) buttons:

* The launcher button will open the *Launcher* in which you can open more
applications by a single click.
* The windows button will open the *Open Windows* in which you can see
all opened windows and access to them.

Try to click any of those buttons to see how the apps are distributed.

## Sidebar ##

Originally, Native would have a bottombar like the topbar with only two (2)
buttons: back and menu. But these design was redundant and unfriendly to the
user, so the bottombar was replaced by a sidebar with some applications
shortcuts. There are some shortcuts that you cannot change.
