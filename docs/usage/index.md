# CNatural User Help #

Hello! and welcome to the CNatural user help. In this folder you will see all
documentation for CNatural, but instead of focusing on a programming view
(like the `handwritten`, `c` or `js` folders) is designed to be readed by a
general user which only wants to build-install-and-use CNatural.

Here are the help topics:

## From scratch series ##

* [From scratch - Login and selecting a DM][lnk1]
* [From scratch - The Native desktop][lnk2]
* [From scratch - Launching apps][lnk3]
* [From scratch - Advanced desktop][lnk4]

## CNatural CLI ##

The *Command Line Interface* (CLI) of the CNatural server is simple and easy,
with each command represented by a one-letter flag (`-s` for example) or a
long-name setting (`--password` for example).

* [CNatural Server CLI][lnk5]

## Notes and links ##
