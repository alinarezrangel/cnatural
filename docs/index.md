# CNatural Built-in Documentation #

Welcome to the CNatural built-in documentation! here you can get help about
all CNatural's APIs and usage. This folder is divided into four subfolders:

* [`js/`](js/out/index.html): Contains the documentation of the JavaScript
client-side APIs of CNatural.
* [`c/`](c/out/html/index.html): Contains the documentation of the C server-side
APIs of CNatural.
* [`handwritten/`](handwritten/index.md): Contains (in Markdown) the documentation
of misc. APIs and others. Generally contains help about how to install
CNatural and other general resources.
* [`usage/`](usage/index.md): Contains (in Markdown) help about CNatural. This
documentation is designed more for a end-user of CNatural.

The JS doc was generated by **jsdoc** and the C doc by **doxygen**.

## Important warning ##

All markdown files was written to be used by a CommonMark-compatible parser and
is assumed that block quotes (like ````lang`) and tables (see below) are supported.

The tables syntax is:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Another  | Cells    |
```
