# CNatural Built-in Documentation #

Welcome to the CNatural built-in documentation! here you can get help about
all CNatural's APIs and usage. This folder is divided into four subfolders:

* [`js/`](js/out/index.html): Contains the documentation of the JavaScript
client-side APIs of CNatural.
* [`c/`](c/out/html/index.html): Contains the documentation of the C server-side
APIs of CNatural.
* [`handwritten/`](handwritten/index.md): Contains (in Markdown) the documentation
of misc. APIs and others. Generally contains help about how to install
CNatural and other general resources.
* [`usage/`](usage/index.md): Contains (in Markdown) help about CNatural. This
documentation is designed more for a end-user of CNatural.

The JS doc was generated by **jsdoc** and the C doc by **doxygen**.
