FIXME: Note that this file should be `docs/c/home.md`, but Doxygen not uses
correctly that file. I (Alejandro Linarez Rangel) tried with doxywizard
and others but Doxygen not reads the `docs/c/home.md` as the mainpage. So,
for now this file is a doxygen-adapted version of the `docs/c/home.md`.

/**
* \mainpage CNatural Server C API
*
* CNatural have two interfaces: one in the server and one in the client.
* This is the documentation **for the server API** and all programs here
* are executed on the **server**.
*
* \section sec1 Using the APIs on your app/changes
*
* Remember to explicitly include all your dependencies before use
* your code! CNatural's Server side API will not import automaticly
* anything as the client side API will.
*
* \section sec2 Using the APIs **inside** an API
*
* See the header and source files to get an idea about the import
* order.
*
* \section sec3 Viewing this documentation
*
* You should `make docsc` in the root directory of the project
* for construct all HTML, JS, CSS and other files in the `out/html/`
* directory. After doing `make docsc` open the `docs/c/out/html/index.html`
* file in your favorite web browser.
